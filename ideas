WHAT I ALREADY DID
-removed hustle bar
-removed the descriptions array, strengths, weaknesses
-this is now strictly a find comps tool
-added 3 different json files for three position classifications (guard, wing, big) with percentile values instead of raw numbers (more on this below)

IDEAS FOR IMPLEMENTATION:

-We now have three different JSON files by position of guard/wing/big (I manually cleaned the data on these a bit to make sure the positions were right)
-user should be able to check a guard/wing/big box (we will need to redo the positions checkboxes), select values, and get their NBA comp


COMPS ALGORITHM (TODO)
-to add more sophistication over a simple true/false value for various skills, we need to develop a better algorithm
-I separated the player data into percentiles (ex. Steven Adams -- 52.6th percentile in 3pt percentage for bigs, 52.8th percentile in points for bigs, 81.7th percentile in rebounding for bigs, etc. etc.)
-when a user selects 60/100 for 3pt percentage and selects the big checkbox, my idea is for the app to iterate over all of the bigs in the JSON, then calculate a score.
    -SCORE BASIS
        -take absolute value of (user input for 3pt percentage, in our example 60) - (player[x]3pt percentage, in steven adams example, 52.6) = 7.4
        -we take absolute value for every characteristic (shooting, defense, passing, etc) and add them up to get a composite score. we do this for every player in our player array.
        -every player in the player array will then have some composite score value. the three lowest values are going to be your three closest comps. this is what we spit out in our results page
    -example
        -user input:
            -80/100 shooting
            -60/100 scoring
            -50/100 rebounding
            -40/100 passing
            -30/100 ballhandling
            -20/100 defense
        -steven adams in our json:
            -"Player": "Steven Adams",
            "3p_Percentile": 0.526,
            "points_Percentile": 0.528,
            "rebounding_Percentile": 0.817,
            "assist_Percentile": 0.772,
            "turnover_Percentile": 0.544,
            "defense_Percentile": 0.783,
        -steven adams composite score = absolute value (80-52.6) + abs(60-52.8) + abs(50-81.7) + abs(40-77.2) + abs(30-54.4) + abs(20-78.3)
